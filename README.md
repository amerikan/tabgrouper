# Tabtastic

**Tabtastic** is a free Firefox add-on that helps you wrangle your current open tabs.

## Purpose

During research I tend to open several tabs, sometimes I end up with duplicate tabs opened or tabs that are from the same domain scattered all over. The goal of this project is to help solve those problems via a Firefox add-on.

## üèÅ Road Map

‚ö†Ô∏è UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

- [x] sorts all open tab based on domain
- [x] eliminates duplicates
- [ ] grouped by day
- [ ] create icon

## Development

**Requires**: node, firefox

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

Run extension in firefox:

```sh
npm start
```

Will install the add-on temporarily and will watch for changes made.
