# Tabtastic

**Tabtastic** is a free Firefox add-on that helps you wrangle your current open tabs.

## Purpose

During research I tend to open several tabs, sometimes I end up with duplicate tabs opened or tabs that are from the same domain scattered all over. The goal of this project is to help solve those problems via a Firefox add-on.

## 🏁 Road Map

- [ ] sorts all open tab based on domain
- [ ] eliminates duplicates
